# Running the server

Use `npm start` to start the server. Configure the port in the index.js file.  
Default port is 3000.

# Development

Run `npm run build` or `npm run build:watch` to generate all files after changes have been made.  
Note that changes to the index.js require a server restart.  
All important files are within `src/` though most of them are generated automatically.  
The most interesting files will be the components in `src/include` as well as the `src/styles/home.scss` file.
