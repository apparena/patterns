##### Breaking Changes
The '_patterns' folder was renamed to 'patterns'. If you were using something like
```javascript
import ... from "apparena-patterns-react/_patterns/...";
```
It has to be rewritten like so:
```javascript
import ... from "apparena-patterns-react/patterns/...";
```

##### 2.0.0
- Complete refactoring (See #45)

##### 1.0.9
- Added Button
- Added DropDown
- Added FilterBar
- Added ButtonGroup
