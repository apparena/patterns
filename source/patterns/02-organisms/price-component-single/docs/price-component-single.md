### What problem does this solve?

This component is a easy-to-use UI to purchase service hours
for a single product from the App-Arena store.

### When and how to use this pattern?

Use this pattern if you want users to be able to purchase more service hours.
Please consult the example code if you want to know how to use it.

The `onClick` function behaves the same way as described in the
[Price Table](/#/PriceTable).
