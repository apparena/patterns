Page Header
---

The page header gives a title and context to the content within a page. It may contain additional navigation, metadata 
and actions relating to the page content.

**Title:** The title of the page (e.g. 'Dashboard') or the name of the object in a collection 
(e.g. the 'DEV-210: New actions bar' branch in a repository). This is the only required element. 

**Breadcrumbs:** The full path to the content is show as breadcrumbs. The middle steps of a breadcrumb may be truncated
 if the path is long. 
 
**Metadata:** Any additional information about the content (e.g. date created, author) that is not part of the content 
itself. 

**Actions:** Use this for actions that apply to the object or entire content on a page. Actions that are specific to one 
section of the page should be placed in that section and not in the page header.
