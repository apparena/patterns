### When and how to use this pattern?

You should use this pattern if you need to show additional information to the end user.
You can, for example, notify the user that a particular action completed successfully.  
Its usage is rather straightforward, you only need to set the `header` and `type` props
with appropriate values and add your notification content as children to the notification.  
Please consult the code example for more information.
