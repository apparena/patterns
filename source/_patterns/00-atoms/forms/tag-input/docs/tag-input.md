Tag Input
---

The 'Tag Input' component behaves almost exactly like the 'Select Menu' component,
thus it is [advised to get familiar with it first](/#/SelectMenu).

The key difference is that the 'Tag Input' allows users to create their own options as well.
Otherwise this component behaves exactly the same as the 'Select Menu'
and is used in the same way.
